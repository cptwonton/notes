#### What is Spring?
- open source Java platform, provides infrastructure support for developing robust Java apps quickly
- written by Rod Johnson, released in June 2003 under Apache 2.0 license
- most popular app development framework for enterprise Java 
- very lightweight, basic version is only 2MB
- goal is to make J2EE development easier to use
- promotes good programming practices by using POJO-based programming model

#### Benefits of Spring?
- allows developers to develop enterprise-class apps using POJOs (plain-old java objects)
  - do not need an EJB container product, like app server
  - can instead use robust servlet container like Tomcat
- modular, so pick and chose what I want
- reuses existing technologies like logging frameworks, timers, etc...
- testing is very easy using depedency injection and bc environment-dependent code is moved into the framework
- Spring's web framework is MVC
- convenient API to translate technology specific exceptions into consistent, unchecked exceptions
- IoC containers are more lightweight compared to EJB containers
- Dependency Injection, one form of Inversion of Control (IoC), makes things more modular and allows for good testing practices
